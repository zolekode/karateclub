    r"""An implementation of `"Walklets" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02115>`_
    from the ASONAM '17 paper "Don't Walk, Skip! Online Learning of Multi-scale
    Network Embeddings". The procedure uses random walks to approximate the
    pointwise mutual information matrix obtained by individual normalized
    adjacency matrix powers. These are all decomposed by an approximate
    factorization technique and the embeddings are concatenated together.

    Args:
        walk_number (int): Number of random walks. Default is 10.
        walk_length (int): Length of random walks. Default is 80.
        dimensions (int): Dimensionality of embedding. Default is 32.
        workers (int): Number of cores. Default is 4.
        window_size (int): Matrix power order. Default is 4.
        epochs (int): Number of epochs. Default is 1.
        learning_rate (float): HogWild! learning rate. Default is 0.05.
        min_count (int): Minimal count of node occurences. Default is 1.
